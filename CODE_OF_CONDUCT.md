# Code of Conduct
The following describes expectations of those working on the project in any capacity.

- Piracy is **NOT** permitted. Period. That is the #1 cause of emulators being shut down. If you're seen promoting it, or linking it, you will be banned. No questions, zero tolerance.
- Disagreements happen, just treat others with the same respect you expect from them.
- If you need advice, ask. Someone will likely be willing to assist you.
- Harassment of any kind will likely be subject to banishment. Just be kind. We are all here for the same reason.
